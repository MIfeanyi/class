    <h2>History of Michael's Garage Sale</h2>
    <p>
        In 2020 a Georgia city called Douglasville suffered massive fires due to all of Atlanta burning down due to a fire at
        1017 Brick Squad lean factory.

    <blockquote cite="https://www.vice.com/en/topic/brick-squad">
        <p>
            1017 was my biggest influence in starting my garage sale.
        </p>

    <p>
        Michael Redford opened his <mark>sale in 2010 which was equal parts intriguing and confusing. </mark> 
        Upon its initial reveal, the garage sale was packaged as an important moment &ge; because the sale marked the end of a longstanding feud between east and west Atlanta. &cross;
        By most accounts, east and west Atlanta are currently on good terms.
        So it wasn’t clear what <em>Michael's intentions were,</em>
        though by alluding to his 2012 robbery <blockquote>“Say the east robbed me / I stole cameras allegedly”</blockquote>
        <strong>it didn’t seem like Michael was extending any kind of olive branch.</strong>
