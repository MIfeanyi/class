    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <aside>
      <em>Advertising</em> is a great way to attract business. Creative advertising is more memorable,
      longer lasting, works with less media spending
    </aside>
    <p>
      A <em>Craiglist</em> is a advertisements website with sections devoted to sales, items wanted, services, etc.
      It's a great spot to advertise your sale. Make sure you plan ahead and detail your inventory in your submission.
      Facebook sales groups are also a great way to let people know what you have for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newpaper ads and signs work well but what happens if your sign falls? What if no one reads the
       paper this because the world isn't on fire?

  <li id="Entertainment">
    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spotify, Youtube, etc is easy Entertainment.</li>
      <li>Make viewing items fun. Adopt an IKEA walk through setup.</li>
      <li>Make sure everything is setup properly. A TV with a demo of an old console might do just the trick.</li>
      <li>Be active and entertain your guests. Smaller events allow you to be closer with your customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I grew Mike's Garage Sale with these methods.</h3>
    <p>
      At first I used signs and I got some turn out. Signs aren't the easiest to see at times. Better marketing produces better results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give your guests a reason to stay. Hot dogs, cotton candy, and burgers are very small investments but can turn a profit or keep buyers eyeing that
      one item they want. Try it. Playing some music is cheap as well!
    </p>

  <sup>1</sup> There will be only a limit of 4 people in the garage at a time. A mask and washing your hands are mandatory. No exceptions. Masks will be sold!
